- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TusharDhanai
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things. I work as an Web development intern, and particulary love working with javascript, that seems the most challenging work. Working on
  back-end is also great, but usually I just have to repeat things. I would love to do game development, not as a career, but as a hobby. Other than that, just knowing as much as I
  can about everything makes me happy.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning c++, data structures, algorithms, nodejs, and some other skills for the office life. I like to work on multiple things, so I don't get bored.
- ðŸ“« If you want to reach me here's my email -- dhanai.tushar007@gmail.com.
